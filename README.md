# PuppyPuzzle
This is a gridster web app that lets you move around widgets to finish a simple puzzle. There is also the functionality to add other widgets, which will add a widget with another picture. This is not a very focused or polished project, just something to practice my skills with gridster and improve in javascript/jquery. Here is a screenshot of the project:

I'm not that good at clipping pictures, so sorry for that.
